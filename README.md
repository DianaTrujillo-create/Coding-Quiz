Quiz intended to challenge the user on their JavaScript knowledge in a timeley manner. This quiz contains HTML, JAVASCRIPT, AND CSS. I found it to be challenging and found myself accidently commiting to a different branch and decided to start over with a whole different respitory. I was able to use the following resources with this assignment:
